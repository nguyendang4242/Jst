# Jst
Jst - a Reddit scraper implemented in python using Requests and BeautifulSoup4

<b>What does Jst do?</b>

Jst queries the user for subreddit names, then displays the title and post of self-posts. This program was originally made for joke subreddits (such as r/Jokes, r/dadjokes, etc.) hence the name.
